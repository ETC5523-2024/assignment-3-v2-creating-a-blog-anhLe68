I am a Master’s student specializing in Business Analytics at Monash University, with a strong passion for data analysis, exploration, and visualization. My academic journey began with a solid foundation in economics and finance, which I pursued during my Bachelor’s degree. This background, combined with hands-on experience in finance and customer service, has sharpened my research and analytical skills, enabling me to generate insightful reports and data-driven solutions.

I am eager to apply my expertise in real-world projects, embracing challenges across diverse fields and tasks. I look forward to leveraging my skills to drive meaningful impact in a dynamic, data-centric environment.
